run_analysis.R — an R script that loads the Samsung Data and generates a tidy datasets. 
The R script is well commented, however, 
the essential steps within the script are:
1. Load activity_labels.txt and features.txt into datasets.
2. Load X_test.txt and y_test.txt files into datasets.
3. Assign column names to dataset from features
4. Add subject and activity columns to data
5. Repeat steps 2,3,and 4 for X_train.txt and y_train.txt 
6. Union the test and train datasets into one new combined dataset
7. Create a new dataset that has only subject, activity, and all mean and std columns
8. For the new dataset in step 7 add a new activity_label column based on the activity and the relevant dataset from set 2.
9. Start to make the dataset in step 8 tidy by melting or normalizing the mean and std columns into separate variables and values for each subject and activity_label pair.
10. Complete the tidying process by calculating the average (mean) for each subject, activity_label, and variable.
11. Output the resulting dataset (optionally write to file).

Codebook.txt — a file describing the variables generated by above script.
